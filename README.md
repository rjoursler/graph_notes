# Graph Theory Comprehensive Notes

This repository contains a collection of theorems and sample problems
for the graph theory originally targetting the comprehensive exam at
Arizona State University. Most of the theorems are found in Diestel's
Graph Theory and when a theorem number is mentioned, that number
refers to the 3rd edition. Most of the proofs that are provided are
generally similar to proofs in Diestel's Graph Theory or West's
Introduction to Graph Theory. This document is somewhat incomplete,
some proofs are missing, some proofs are better described as proof
summaries, and the occasional proof may be
incorrect. Corrections/additions/improvements to this document are
welcome and can be submitted to this documents GitHub page located at
https://github.com/rjoursler/graph_notes.
